About these files & directories:
	mem.c and mem.h :
		re-implement standard memory and string
		manipulation functions provided by the standard C library.
	
	consoleout.h :
		provides a single function to write a block
		of bytes to output using the system call write(). This
		code will be replaced in future iterations.
 
	test.c : 
		a simple test file to verify that the mem.h functions 
		work as described.
	documentation/ :
		a directory containing html and latex based documentation
		produced with doxygen
	hw1_config :
		a doxygen configuration file.

Documentation :
	> for more information please refer to the source files 
		which are heavily documented.
	> additionally, doxygen documentation has been provided
		in html and latex format :)

Special Considerations: 
	printf()
		This function can print to an arbitrarily large output size,
		as limited by system memory. 
	
	ASSERT macro :
		This code is largely based on code I read in the 
		following book :  "A Book On C" 4th Ed.
	 	By Al Kelley & Ira Pohl	pg 389. Except for the last
	 	line that calls the kill() system call, this
	 	macro has been copied almost verbatim. All credit 
	 	is due to the authors of this text.
